# CI/CD Pipeline Demo Project

## Overview

This repository serves as a demonstration of a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. The purpose of this project is to showcase the automation of software delivery processes, from code changes to deployment, through a streamlined pipeline.

## Features

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: The repository includes a fully configured CI/CD pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment processes.
  
- **Demo Application**: A simple demo application is provided to demonstrate the pipeline in action. This application can be modified and extended as needed.

- **Documentation**: This README.md file provides an overview of the project, instructions for setting up and running the pipeline, and any additional information necessary for understanding and using the demo project.

## Setup and Usage

To use this demo project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: If the demo application has any dependencies, ensure they are installed. Refer to the application's documentation for specific instructions.

3. **Configure CI/CD Pipeline**: Depending on your CI/CD platform (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions), configure the pipeline to suit your environment. This may involve setting up environment variables, defining stages, and configuring triggers.

4. **Customize Demo Application**: Modify the demo application code to fit your requirements. This can include adding features, fixing bugs, or making any necessary adjustments.

5. **Trigger Pipeline**: Make a change to the repository (e.g., push a new commit) to trigger the CI/CD pipeline. Monitor the pipeline's progress and ensure that each stage executes successfully.

6. **Deployment**: Once the pipeline completes successfully, verify that the changes have been deployed according to the defined deployment strategy.
